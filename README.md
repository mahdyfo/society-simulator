# Human-Effect

## Overview
What makes world, good to live is its people. If we can compute human behaviours based on different impressions, thoughts and social norms, we can predict his actions. Viseversa, if we know the human behaviours of a country, we can predict the social future of that country.

- Countries and governments are affected by human **behaviours**.
- Human behaviours are affected by their **characteristics**.
- Characteristics are affected by **thoughts**. (experiences affect thoughts)
- thoughts and experiences make human **properties**.

**Now let's go reverse:**

- thoughts and experiences make human **properties**.
- Characteristics are affected by **thoughts**. (experiences affect thoughts)
- Human behaviours are affected by their **characteristics**.
- Countries and governments are affected by human **behaviours**.

The good thing is that human thoughts and experiences can be highly modified by specific programs in life.

We start from the **smallest properties** and make a modular mechanism to calculate the big impacts. By defining a good relation between human _properties_ and _behaviours_, we are able to model a suitable society. The point is that is a computerized model and can assure the functionality.

## Models
### Thoughts
Each human have a set of thoughts and experiences can affect thoughts. These will change human properties.
Each belief influences different features. For example a thought may have good effects on responsibility and trustworthy, and bad effects on happiness. Another thought can change other things as well. A person is a character of thoughts.

### Person
A person has different thoughts that affect his life style. Other people also have effect on each person which is the social norm.

### Actions
Human actions are mostly done by his thoughts. We can predict actions by knowing a person thoughts, with a high precision.
Action prediction is really difficult because it is affected by many many factors that including all of them is not easy. So we can make a fault tolerance to guess the unpredictable ones.

### Society
What makes a society, is the human actions. By knowing what every person may do, social properties can be predicted as well.
